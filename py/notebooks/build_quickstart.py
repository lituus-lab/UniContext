`unicontext` is a Cython extension over the UniContext C ABI, shipped as a
self-contained wheel: the native library travels inside the package, so
installing it needs neither Nim nor a compiler.

```
pip install lituus-unicontext
```

CI executes this notebook against the wheel the release actually publishes, so
an output below that stops matching fails the build."""),

Deliberately little. A context packet is a document, not a struct: marshalling
one across a C boundary would mean an ownership convention for every string in
it, so packets cross that boundary as JSON through the MCP server instead
(`unicontext serve`). What the ABI does expose is what a caller needs *before*
asking for a packet."""),

it."""),
